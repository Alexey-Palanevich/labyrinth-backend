# Maze Guide

## Introduction

You live in a terrible world.

You're a `dungeon guide`. You earn money by guiding adventures from one end of the labyrinth to the other.
It's a dangerous job. You may be lost, caught by a trap or killed by a monster.
Hopefully, the danger depends on the depth of the dungeon. The deeper you go, the greater the danger, but
also the greater the payment for services. But the adventurers won't speak with you, if you don't have
`a clarification certificate`. You can get the certificate from `The Maze Guild`.

## Clarification

Guild has next guide's graduations:

- Junior
- Middle
- Senior

### Junior

You can find the exit from the labyrinth, it may not be optimal and you'll spend hours for searching, but finally you
will go out.

### Middle

You can find the exit from the labyrinth and it'll be the shortest way. Adventures like you, you save their time for
acceptable many.

### Senior

You can find the shortest path from the labyrinth, but mostly adventures ask you for help, when they want find
hiding `treasure`. You may include the treasures in the path for additional payment.

### Leader

You're a legend, you go in the deepest levels, find the richest `treasures` and bypass ancient `Liches`.
